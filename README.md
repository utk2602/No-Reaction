# No reaction– Build React from Scratch
**unreacted** is a lightweight, educational project that recreates core React functionality using plain TypeScript — from virtual DOM rendering to custom hooks — all in a compact, understandable codebase.

> I built this to gain a deeper understanding of how React works under the hood.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ **Essential hooks**: `useState`, `useEffect`
- ⚙️ **Component-based rendering** logic
- 📦 **Tiny footprint**: ~9.7 kB packaged, 30.4 kB unpacked (or 49.8 kB with a favicon!)
- 📄 **Readable codebase**: Most files are under 100 lines of code

The main logic resides in the `src/` folder, covering everything from rendering and virtual DOM diffing to hook implementation.

Start writing your own components in `src/app.ts`. It's intentionally raw and low-level — perfect for learning purposes.

> ⚠️ **Not production-ready** — and not meant to be — but a great way to learn React's internals.
